# TSBPD

TSBPD stands for **Time-Stamp Based Packet Delivery**. The mechanism is described in [SRT RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-sharabayko-srt-00#section-4.5).

An in-depth overview of the latency in SRT is given in the [SRT Latency](./latency).

An overview of SRT latency negotiation and the negotiated latency calculator can be found on the [Latency Negotiation](./latency-negotiation) page.
