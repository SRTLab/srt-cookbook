For detailed information, guidelines and use cases, please visit TSDuck website . TSDuck Installation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS This is a little how-to on building TSduck for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with SRT support. Build from Source Building instructions See building instructions at: https://tsduck.io/doxy/building.html mkdir tsduck cd tsduck git clone https://github.com/tsduck/tsduck.git Execute the shell-script: build/install-prerequisites.sh It downloads and installs the requested packages which are necessary to build TSDuck. The list of packages and how to install them depend on the operating system distribution and version. Building without specialized dependencies In specific configurations, you may want to disable some external libraries such as libcurl or pcsc-lite . Of course, the corresponding features in TSDuck will be disabled but the impact is limited. For instance, disabling libcurl will disable the plugin http (the plugin will still be there but it will report an error when used). The following make variables can be defined: NOTEST : Do not build unitary tests. NODTAPI : No Dektec support, remove dependency to DTAPI . NOCURL : No HTTP support, remove dependency to libcurl . NOPCSC : No smartcard support, remove dependency to pcsc-lite . NOSRT : No SRT (Secure Reliable Transport), remove dependency to libsrt . NOTELETEXT : No Teletext support, remove teletext handling code. make NOPCSC=1 NOCURL=1 NODTAPI=1 To speed up the compilation time a optional number of parallel threads can be set with the option -j10 make would use 10 parallel processes: make -j10 NOPCSC=1 NOCURL=1 NODTAPI=1 Set PATH to run from directory On all Unix systems, the binaries, plugins and tests are built inside the bin subdirectory. To run a tool from its build directory, a few environment variables shall be defined (including $PATH ). A shell-script named setenv.sh in the build directory defines the appropriate environment for running binaries. Execute: source build/setenv.sh Note the usage of the source command to make sure that the environment variables are defined in the current shell. Example: $ source build/setenv.sh $ which tsp ~/tsduck/bin/release-x86_64-vmubuntu/tsp $ tsp --version tsp: TSDuck - The MPEG Transport Stream Toolkit - version 3.26-2313 Optionally install TSDuck on system sudo make install Cleaning up On Linux and macOS, the same cleanup task is achieved using the following command: make distclean How to replay a .ts file as a stream 1.

SRT as input or output Up to TSDuck version 3.25, the srt input plugin used the caller mode and the srt output plugin used the listener mode. From TSDuck version 3.26 onwards, the srt input and output plugins can indifferently use caller, listener or rendezvous modes, using the same consistent set of command line options. See the TSDuck user's guide for a complete reference. The following examples are based on version 3.26. 4. Replay .ts file as SRT-Listener stream Now it's time to get started. There are some differences with the TSDuck SRT implementation compared to other SRT applications. Typically you only specify a port without IP like srt://:4900 and a SRT-listener on port 4900 will be created. If you specify an IP:port combination, SRT typically would act as SRT-caller to that IP:port (e.g. srt://192.168.2.49:4900 ) With TSDuck, you can create a listener port and optionally specify the adapter, which it should listen on using --listener port or --listener interface:port . In this test the Linux machine has two interfaces and the one with IP 192.168.2.3 was chosen to act as listening interface. tsp -I file --infinite /home/n00b/Videos/StressTest_4KP25_h264.ts -P regulate -O srt --listener 192.168.2.3:4900 --transtype live --messageapi It is also possible to just specify the port without a particular interface to use: tsp -I file --infinite /home/n00b/Videos/StressTest_4KP25_h264.ts -P regulate -O srt --listener 4900 --transtype live --messageapi A detail worth mentioning: -O srt --listener \"[IP:]Port\" for tsp already specifies the usage of the SRT protocol. So there is no need to add the srt:// prefix to the IP or DNS-name. Adding it would actually result in an error. Now another SRT application can connect to that SRT stream on 192.168.2.3:4900 provided by tsp , e.g., srt-live-transmit sample application to flip it back to MPEG-TS. srt-live-transmit.exe srt://192.168.2.3:4900 udp://192.168.2.49:10002 Or VLC player: press CTRL+N to open a new network stream and type in URL srt://192.168.2.3:4900 to connect to the stream in this example. Analyzing incoming SRT stream Incoming SRT stream containing MPEG-TS one can also be analyzed. The following example would connect in caller mode to the SRT stream, which was sent out using tsp as described in the section above and perform an analysis for 10 seconds: tsp -I srt --caller 192.168.2.3:4900 --transtype live --messageapi -P until --seconds 10 -P analyze -O drop It would generate an output to stdout like this (shortened) =============================================================================== | TRANSPORT STREAM ANALYSIS REPORT | |=============================================================================| | Transport Stream Id: .......... 1 (0x0001) | Services: .............. 1 | | Bytes: ........................ 99,391,840 | PID's: Total: .......... 4 | | TS packets: ...................... 528,680 | Clear: .......... 4 | | With invalid sync: .................. 0 | Scrambled: ...... 0 | | With transport error: ............... 0 | With PCR's: ..... 1 | | Suspect and ignored: ................ 0 | Unreferenced: ... 0 | |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Transport stream bitrate, based on ....... 188 bytes/pkt 204 bytes/pkt | | User-specified: ......................... 69,642,777 b/s 75,569,821 b/s | | Estimated based on PCR's: ............... 58,771,501 b/s 63,773,331 b/s | |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Broadcast time: .................................... 11 sec (0 mn 11 sec) | |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Srv Id Service Name Access Bitrate | | 0x0001 Service01 ....................................

It is a very powerful tools to analyse network traffic, such as a connection. Since version 3.0 Wireshark supports the SRT protocol and display filters can be applied to find particular elements of a SRT stream easily TShark is a terminal oriented version of Wireshark designed for capturing and displaying packets when an interactive user interface isn't necessary or available. Both tools - TShark and Wireshark with GUI - can be used to create packet captures, which are helpful to reproduce errors remotely or to feed other analysis tools such as lib-tcpdump-processing . If you only want to capture files and do the analysis on a remote machine, installation of TShark is sufficient. Installation Installing TShark & Wireshark on CentOS TShark on CentOS is part of the CLI-version of Wireshark. To install use following command: sudo yum install wireshark This will install tshark in /usr/sbin/tshark To install Wireshark with GUI, do the following: sudo yum install wireshark-gnome Installing TShark & Wireshark on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Ubuntu 18.04 only provides Wireshark version 2.6, which has no native SRT support. To install the desired 3.0 or higher version, you could either build Wireshark yourself or follow the instructions from launchpad to get a binary package. Basically you would add a Personal Package Archive (PPA) to your package repository with following 3 commands. For detailed instructions check the launchpad page at link above. sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wireshark-dev/stable sudo apt-get update sudo apt install wireshark tshark To install the GUI version of Wireshark use following command after adding the PPA: sudo apt-get install wireshark-qt Installing TShark & Wireshark on Ubuntu 19+ Recent versions of Ubuntu serve version 3+ versions of TShark & Wireshark. sudo apt-get update sudo apt install wireshark tshark To install the GUI version of Wireshark use following command: sudo apt-get install wireshark-qt Installing TShark & Wireshark on MacOS and Windows Please download the Wireshark installer for MacOS or Windows directly from the Wireshark download site and follow the instructions of the installer. TShark installation can be optionally selected (default is on). Using TShark to capture network traffic In order to get best results for further analysis, the network capture should be started before the SRT connection is initiated. So we capture the SRT handshake as well, which can be useful later on. Linux & MacOS Let's assume you are receiving a SRT stream on UDP port 4200 and want to capture it. First you want to make sure, that you are capturing the traffic on the right interface. If your system has multiple network interfaces you could use following command to list all available interfaces: (depending on your settings, you might need root privileges, which can be granted with sudo command) Most Linux systems: sudo ip a MacOS and some Linux systems: sudo ifconfig Once you have identified the interface of your choice run following command: (some systems might need root priviliges to execute packet captures. Use sudo command then) tshark -i enp9s0 -f \"udp port 4200\" -s 1500 -w ./rcv-SRT.pcapng -i enp9s0 specifies the interface. Depending on your system this could also be -i eth0 or -i eno1 or whatever the particular interface is named like -f \"udp port 4200\" specifies a filter rule to only capture UDP packets on port 4200 -s 1500 defines the snapshot length to capture, in this case 1500 bytes per packet -w ./rcv-SRT.pcapng sets the path and filename in which the captured data is written. In this case in the same directory that you are currently in with the file name rcv-SRT.pcapng Windows The procedure on Windows is quite similar, however the naming conventions for the network adapters can be a confusing. With following command you can found out IP addresses of your network interfaces: ipconfig /all Note down the name of the Ethernet adapter of your choice with the correct IP address that you were looking for. In this example we are looking at Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection 2: Now point your shell (Terminal / PowerShell) to the Wireshark directory, which is per default: c:\\Program Files\\Wireshark and execute following command: tshark.exe -D The option -D lists all interfaces, unfortunately without IP address. But we already identified the IP with the ipconfig command in the prior step. The output would give you something like this: c:\\Program Files\\Wireshark>tshark.exe -D 1. \\Device\\NPF_{C4423365-7B46-493C-95E8-2F009A099E0A} (VMware Network Adapter VMnet8) 2. \\Device\\NPF_{78032B7E-4968-42D3-9F37-287EA86C0AAA} (Local Area Connection* 10) 3. \\Device\\NPF_{B9A7544E-73D8-4533-BC46-C3A2B99D68BF} (VirtualBox Host-Only Network) 4. \\Device\\NPF_NdisWanIp (NdisWan Adapter) 5. \\Device\\NPF_{A0B05D56-015A-4045-832F-E244BC32F9DC} (Local Area Connection) 6. \\Device\\NPF_NdisWanBh (NdisWan Adapter) 7. \\Device\\NPF_NdisWanIpv6 (NdisWan Adapter) 8. \\Device\\NPF_{03564282-7495-4FB5-98A2-CF349E10BE23} (Local Area Connection 2) 9. \\Device\\NPF_{663F8BBF-7C41-494B-B2BA-269DA97B8B49} (VMware Network Adapter VMnet1) 10. \\Device\\NPF_{3556DA2E-DEC6-410B-B791-E82CC8ABF216} (Local Area Connection 10) 11. \\Device\\NPF_Loopback (Adapter for loopback traffic capture) 12. \\Device\\NPF_{1949D5F2-F562-4C4E-8665-EABC55BFBFFC} (Local Area Connection 4) 13. \\Device\\NPF_{F4A0A87F-5DB3-42E5-A29E-C061045C1E99} (Local Area Connection 11) The adapter of our choice in this example ( Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection 2 ) has the ID 8 . Finally we can use the ID 8 to perform the network capture by issuing following command: tshark.exe -i 8 -f \"udp port 4200\" -s 1500 -w c:\\temp\\rcv-SRT.pcapng Best practice tips start the capture before starting the SRT transmission name the .pcapng files in a way, which gives you a clue later on. For example use rcv or snd in filename and maybe something like testrun-1 or other identifiers, which help to understand what you did later on on Linux and MacOS you can specify a particular length of time to run the capture with help of timeout command. For example use following command to capture 30 seconds of traffic sudo timeout 30 tshark -i enp9s0 -f \"udp port 4900\" -s 1500 -w ./rcv-SRT.pcapng to stop a capture without timeout given just use the keyboard command CTRL + C timeout on Windows works a bit different. To perform a 30 second capture you can use: start \"\" app.exe & timeout /t 30 & taskkill /im app.exe /f for our example this would result in: start \"\" tshark.exe -i 8 -f \"udp port 4200\" -s 1500 -w c:\\temp\\rcv-SRT.pcapng & timeout 30 & taskkill /im tshark.exe /f Analysing the .pcapng capture file lib-tcpdump-processing Specifically for network captures of SRT streams you can use the python scripts out of the library lib-tcpdump-processing provided by Maria Sharabayko. It's a great set of tools to analyse details of an SRT stream and get details quickly.

To do that, click on Analyse in the menu bar on top and select Enabled Protocols from the dropdown menu. (keyboard shortcut: CTRL+SHIFT+E ). Now search for UDT and uncheck the UDT-options which are displayed like shown in picture below. Now you can import your captured .pcapng file or start a live capture from inside the Wireshark GUI. A list of possible \"display filters\" for the SRT protocol can be found at the Wireshark SRT Display Filter Reference page . There are cases when Wireshark will not pass the remainder of the UDP packet to sub-dissectors. SRT is a sub-dissector of UDP. This case is in the decode_udp_ports function of Wireshark, and has the following comment description: Do lookups with the subdissector table. We try the port number with the lower value first, followed by the port number with the higher value. This means that, for packets where a dissector is registered for both port numbers: 1) we pick the same dissector for traffic going in both directions; 2) we prefer the port number that's more likely to be the right one (as that prefers well-known ports to reserved ports); although there is, of course, no guarantee that any such strategy will always pick the right port number. XXX - we ignore port numbers of 0, as some dissectors use a port number of 0 to disable the port, and as RFC 768 says that the source port in UDP datagrams is optional and is 0 if not used. :exclamation: Wireshark offers a workaround for this. You have to set the following advanced option: Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced: udp.try_heuristic_first = TRUE .

Check for existing SSH key pair or generate a new one on your local machine Enter ls -al ~/.ssh to see if existing SSH keys are present: ls -al ~/.ssh # Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist If you don't have an existing public and private key pair, or don't wish to use any that are available to connect to remote server, then generate a new SSH key : ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/mykey -t rsa -b 4096 This generates a public/private rsa key pair. The algorithm is selected using the -t option and key size using the -b option. The filename is specified using the -f <filename> option. Then you will be promted to enter a passphrase. The passphrase is used for encrypting the key, so that it cannot be used even if someone obtains the private key file. The passphrase should be cryptographically strong. The online random password generator is one possible tool for generating strong passphrases. 2. Copy the public key to the remote server To use public key authentication, the public key must be copied to a server and installed in an authorized_keys file. This can be conveniently done using the ssh-copy-id tool. Like this: ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/mykey user@host Once the public key has been configured on the server, the server will allow any connecting user that has the private key to log in. During the login process, the client proves possession of the private key by digitally signing the key exchange. The copying may ask for a password or other authentication for the server. It's important to note that only the public key is copied to the server. The private one should never be copied to remote machine. Now try logging into the server with ssh user@host and check to make sure that only the key you wanted was added: cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 3. Test the new key Try logging into the server with ssh -i ~/.ssh/mykey user@host The login should now complete without asking for a password. Note, however, that the command might ask for the passphrase you've specified for the key. Adding the Key to SSH Agent ssh-agent is a program that can hold a user's private key, so that the private key passphrase only needs to be supplied once. A connection to the agent can also be forwarded when logging into a server, allowing SSH commands on the server to use the agent running on the user's desktop.

LastSND timer is updated when SRT socket is created, when a connection is established (since SRT v1.3.3, PR #745 ), when a control or data packet is sent. A special update happens when a handshake message is sent in response to incomming handshare packet (this does not happen via sendCtrl()). The value is used to trigger sending a KEEPALIVE message. See Sec. Keepalive Messages. NextACK time. NextNAK time. TargetSND time (TargetTime - rename in source code?) is used in the sender only for rate-based packet sending. In UDT draft referred to as SND timer. Events SRT has different events: ACK, NAK, EXP, SND and RSP. Each event has its own period and they are all independent. They use the system time as origins and should process wrapping if the system time wraps. For a certain periodical event E in SRT, suppose the time variable is ET and its period is p. If E is set or reset at system time t0 (ET = t0), then at any time t1, (t1 - ET >= p) is the condition to check if E should be triggered. ACK is used to trigger an acknowledgment (ACK). Its period is set by the congestion control module, otherwise the default value of 10 ms is used (COMM_SYN_INTERVAL or SYN time). However, SRT will send an ACK no longer than every 0.01 second, even though the congestion control does not need timer-based ACK. Here, 0.01 second is defined as the SYN time, or synchronization time, and it affects many of the other timers used in SRT. NAK is used to trigger a negative acknowledgment (NAK). Its period is dynamically updated to RTT + 4 \u00d7 RTTVar + SYN, where RTTVar is the variance of RTT samples. EXP is used to trigger data packets retransmission and maintain connection status. Its period is dynamically updated to N \u00d7 (RTT + 4 \u00d7 RTTVar + SYN), where N is the number of continuous timeouts. To avoid unnecessary timeout, a minimum threshold (e.g., 0.5 second) should be used in the implementation. UDT: 4 \u00d7 RTT + RTTVar Note that 4 \u00d7 RTT + RTTVar + SYN is described in the UDT draft (Timers section). However, the formula actually used in the UDT v4 source code is RTT + 4 \u00d7 RTTVar + SYN, which is also used in the SRT (as of v1.3.2). UDT v3 just uses 1 sec timeout. In the rest of this document, a name of a time variable will be used to represent the associated event, the variable itself, or the value of its period, depending on the context. For example, ACK can mean either the ACK event or the value of ACK period. Connection Expiration Default 5 seconds. Can be configured by SRTO_PEERIDLETIMEO. TODO: Add details Describe in more details, as it relies on several timers. EXP Event Processing (Currently just copied from UDT draft). Put all the unacknowledged packets into the sender's loss list. If (ExpCount > 16) and at least 3 seconds has elapsed since that last time when ExpCount is reset to 1, or, 3 minutes has elapsed, close the UDT connection and exit. If the sender's loss list is empty, send a keep-alive packet to the peer side. Increase ExpCount by 1. Acknowledgement Messages There are several types of ACK packets: lite ACK, small ACK and full ACK. The default ACK interval ACKInt is 10 ms ( CUDT::m_ullACKInt_tk ). The Congestion Control module can specify a custom ACK interval by overriding the SrtCongestionControlBase::ACKIntervalMicrosec() . Neither LiveCC, nor FileCC specify this value. NextACK time is set to tcur + ACKInt at the start when SRT socket is created and updated when a connection is established (since SRT v1.3.3, PR #745 ). The value is updated on every ACK packet sent as NextACK = tcur + ACKInt, where ACKInt = CC::ACKInt\u00b5s ? CC::ACKInt\u00b5s : CUDT::ACKInt. ACK packet is sent if tcur > NextACK or if Pktsrcvd >= CC::ACKIntpkts, where CC::ACKIntpkts is specified by the Congestion Control. Neither LiveCC, nor FileCC specify this value. Congestion control can also schedule sending the ACK by setting NextACK = tcur if CC::needsQuickACK() returns true. By default LiveCC returns false, and FileCC returns true if the payload size is less than the maximum size (end of file detection). A lite ACK is sent if Pktsrcvd >= 64 (CC:: SELF_CLOCK_INTERVAL). A full ACK is sent if tcur ACKLast > ACKInt. Otherwise a small ACK is sent. ACK for the same sequence may be sent again if tcur - ACKLast >= RTT + 4 \u00d7 RTTVar (see CUDT::sendCtrl()). Keepalive Messages Keepalive messages in SRT are sent based on the LAST_SND timer. LAST_SND timer is updated by the latest control or data packet sent. A KEEPALIVE message is sent if t >= LAST_SND + KEEPALIVE_PERIOD, where KEEPALIVE_PERIOD = 1 sec. Keepalive messages in UDT are sent based on the EXP timer. EXP event is triggered at t >= N \u00d7 (RTT + 4 \u00d7 RTTVar + SYN), where N is the number of continuous timeouts. If N >= 16, the connection is closed. Otherwise if the senders buffer has unacknowledged packets, they are considered lost, added to the lost list, thus scheduled for retransmission. If the sender's buffer has no unacknowledged packets, a KEEPALIVE control packet is sent.It can be calculated, that for an idle connection a KEEPALIVE is sent every RTT + 4 \u00d7 RTTVar + SYN. NAK Reports Sent by Receiver A negative acknowledgment (NAK) report is special SRT control packet, sent by the receiver back to the sender. The packet holds compressed sequence numbers of packets considered lost by the receiver. There are two possibilities for the receiver to report a loss back to the sender. Triggered by Loss Detection Loss detection is based on Gaps in Sequence Numbers. Detection of a packet loss is triggered with the newly received packet. An offset between the newly arrived packet and the last acknowledged position is calculated. In case the offset is negative, the packet is considered belated, meaning that it was either already acknowledged or dropped by TSBPD as too late to be delivered. Such belated packets are ignored. Documentation states the retransmitted packet is not considered belated Check statistics handling any packets after receiver ACK as belated, regardless of the retransmit flag. Should the re-transmitted packets be ignored? An offset between sequence numbers of the arrived packet and the previously received packet is calculated. If the packet is not the next packet in order, then a loss detection mechanism is triggered. First, a gap in sequence numbers of the consecutively received packets might be due to packet reordering. Sequence numbers that should fill the gap are added to the RcvLossList of a socket. Then there is a decision whether a loss report should be sent. A non-zero reorder tolerance (ReorderTolerance <= MaxReorderTolerance) determines if a gap in sequence numbers is allowed. The default value of MaxReorderTolerance is zero, and it can be set with SRTO_LOSSMAXTTL socket option. If ReorderTolerance==0, a loss report is sent immediately for the detected gap. Otherwise, if ReorderTolerance>0, then the detected gap is added to a temporal loss list, with a TTL value equal to current ReorderTolerance value. Each time a DATA packet is received, TTTL of every lost packet in this temporal loss list is decremented by 1. Those packets TODO: Describe ReorderTolerance update logic Example from SRT Periodic NAK Reports showing how a serial loss will be treated.

By default periodic NAK reports are enabled in live mode (SRTO_TRANSTYPE = SRTT_LIVE), and disabled in file mode (SRTO_TRANSTYPE = SRTT_FILE). The functionality is controlled by SRTO_NAKREPORT socket option. NAKtime is the time to send the next periodic NAK report. When t >= NAKtime and the RcvLossList is not empty, a periodic NAK report is sent.

Regularly NAKtime is updated with the last time a periodic NAK report was sent: NAKtime = t + NAKInt . ISSUE #701 . NAK time is updated after sending the periodic NAK report. Should be also updated after sending a regular LOSS report? Or at least update the time if there are no losses in the *RcvLossList* . where NAKInt is an interval between periodic NAK reports. Minimum NAK interval is NAKIntmin=300 ms, and it is set at the very beginning of the streaming. NAK interval NAKInt is updated after sending a loss report. The new value is NAKInt = RTT + 4 \u00d7 RTTVar . This value is passed to the CC module. FileCC can update NAKInt based on the reported receiving speed Rrcv (packets per second) and the length of the loss list LOSSlen: NAKInt = RTT + 4 \u00d7 RTTVar + LOSSlen \u00d7 106 / Rrcv. LiveCC will update NAKInt by dividing it by 2: LOSSlen: NAKInt = (RTT + 4 \u00d7 RTTVar) / 2. The minimum value is NAKInt = max(NAKInt, NAKIntmin). NAKtime is a time to send the next periodic NAK report. The time is initialized at CUDT::open() and after a connection is established (PR #745 ). NAKtime is updated with the last time a periodic NAK report was sent. ISSUE #701 . NAK time is updated after sending the periodic NAK report. Should be also updated after sending a regular LOSS report? When t >= NAKtime and the RcvLossList is not empty, a periodic NAK report is sent. This report includes all the packets in the receiver's loss list ( RcvLossList ). Packet Retransmission (Sender) Retransmission Triggered by NAK Report A packet is scheduled for retransmission if a sender receives a NAK report from the receiver. A loss report may be triggered either by loss detection, or by periodic NAK reports (see NAK Reports section above). Blind Retransmission A blind retransmission is an heuristic mechanism of a sender to trigger packet retransmission without receiving a NAK report from the receiver. Fast Retransmission (FASTREXMIT) FASTREXMIT mode is enabled by LiveCC when the receiver is not expected to send periodic NAK reports. A condition is triggered based on the LastRspAck time. Timer-triggered condition: t > N \u00d7 (RTT + 4 \u00d7 RTTVar + 2 \u00d7 SYN) + SYN, where SYN=10 ms, and N is a number of such retransmissions since last ACK (also reset if the sender's buffer has no unacknowledged packets on the new data submitted by srt_sendmsg). All unacknowledged packets in the sender's buffer are added to the SndLossList and scheduled for retransmission. FASTREXMIT is not present in UDT. Late Retransmission (LATEREXMIT) TODO: User-defined RTT Describe a scenario with a user-defined RTO value. The LATEREXMIT is the default blind retransmission mode of UDT. LATEREXMIT is triggered by the EXP timer. EXP timer in UDT is used to trigger data packets retransmission and maintain connection status. Its period is dynamically updated to N \u00d7 (RTT + 4 \u00d7 RTTVar + SYN), where N is the number of continuous timeouts. To avoid unnecessary timeout, a minimum threshold (e.g., 0.5 second) is used in the implementation. Each time EXP timer is triggered, resend unacknowledged packets currently in the sender's buffer if there are some, otherwise send a KEEPALIVE message. In SRT v1.3.2 and earlier the logic is the same, except that a KEEPALIVE message has its own timer and a timeout of 1 second (see keepalive section above).

Detection of a packet loss is triggered with the newly received packet. An offset between the newly arrived packet and the last acknowledged position is calculated. In case the offset is negative, the packet is considered belated, meaning that it was either already acknowledged or dropped by TSBPD as too late to be delivered. Such belated packets are ignored. Documentation states the retransmitted packet is not considered belated Check statistics handling any packets after receiver ACK as belated, regardless of the retransmit flag. Should the re-transmitted packets be ignored? An offset between sequence numbers of the arrived packet and the previously received packet is calculated. If the packet is not the next packet in order, then a loss detection mechanism is triggered. First, a gap in sequence numbers of the consecutively received packets might be due to packet reordering. Sequence numbers that should fill the gap are added to the RcvLossList of a socket. Then there is a decision whether a loss report should be sent. A non-zero reorder tolerance (ReorderTolerance <= MaxReorderTolerance) determines if a gap in sequence numbers is allowed. The default value of MaxReorderTolerance is zero, and it can be set with SRTO_LOSSMAXTTL socket option. If ReorderTolerance==0, a loss report is sent immediately for the detected gap. Otherwise, if ReorderTolerance>0, then the detected gap is added to a temporal loss list, with a TTL value equal to current ReorderTolerance value. Each time a DATA packet is received, TTTL of every lost packet in this temporal loss list is decremented by 1.

The timing diagram illustrates those key latency points with TSBPD enabled (live mode). End-to-end latency The actual latency on the link will roughly be SRTO_RCVLATENCY + 1/2 \u00d7 RTT 0 , where RTT 0 is the RTT value during the handshake. Packet Delivery Time Packet delivery time is the time point, estimated by the receiver, when a packet should be given (delivered) to the upstream application (via srt_recvmsg(...) ). It consists of the TsbPdTimeBase - the base time difference between sender's and receiver's clock, receiver's buffer delay TsbPdDelay , a timestamp of a data packet PKT_TIMESTAMP , and a time drift Drift . PktTsbPdTime = TsbPdTimeBase + TsbPdDelay + PKT_TIMESTAMP + Drift TSBPD Base Time TsbPdTimeBase is the base time difference between local clock of the receiver, and the clock used by the sender to timestamp packets being sent. A unit of measurement is microseconds. Initial value The value of TsbPdTimeBase is initialized at the time of the conclusion handshake is received as: TsbPdTimeBase = T_NOW - HSREQ_TIMESTAMP . This value roughly corresponds to the one-way network delay ( ~RTT/2 ) between the two SRT peers. TSBPD Wrapping Period The value of TsbPdTimeBase can be updated during the TSBPD wrapping period. The period starts 30 seconds before reaching the maximum timestamp value of a packet ( CPacket::MAX_TIMESTAMP ), and ends whens the timestamp of the received packet is within [30; 60] seconds. CPacket::MAX_TIMESTAMP = 0xFFFFFFFF , or maximum 32-bit unsigned integer value. The value is in microseconds, which corresponds to 1 hour 11 minutes and 35 seconds (01:11:35). In other words, TSBPD time wrapping happens every 01:11:35. During the wrapping period, a packet may have a timestamp either in [ CPacket::MAX_TIMESTAMP - 30s ; CPacket::MAX_TIMESTAMP ] or in [0; 30s]. In the first case, the current value of TsbPdTimeBase is used. In the seconds case, TsbPdTimeBase + CPacket::MAX_TIMESTAMP + 1 is used to calculate TSBPD time for the packet. The wrapping period ends when the timestamp of the received packet is within the interval [30s; 60s]. The updated value will be TsbPdTimeBase += CPacket::MAX_TIMESTAMP + 1 . Time Drift The value of TsbPdTimeBase can be updated by the DriftTracer. Time Drift Sample Upon receipt of an ACKACK packet, the timestamp of this control packet is used as a sample for drift tracing. ACKACK timestamp is expected to be half the round-trip time ago ( RTT/2 ). The drift time DRIFT is calculated from the current time T_NOW ; the TSBPD base time TsbPdTimeBase ; and the timestamp ACKACK_TIMESTAMP of the received ACKACK packet. DRIFT = T_NOW - (TsbPdTimeBase + ACKACK_TIMESTAMP) - \u0394RTT , where \u0394RTT = (RTTSample - RTT0) / 2 or the difference between the current RTT sample calculated from the ACK-ACKACK pair, and the the first RTT sample RTT0 . The motivation for \u0394RTT is to compensate a variation in the network delay from the clock drift estimate. Handshake-based RTT Needed As of SRT v1.4.4 ( PR 1965 ) RTT0 is taken from the very first ACK-ACKACK pair. Assuming it is the best approximation of the actual RTT0 during the handshake. However, the best estimate of the network delay during the handshake would be to estimate RTT based on the exchange of handshakes. The base time should stay in sync with T_NOW - T_SENDER , and should roughly correspond to the network delay ( ~RTT/2 ). The value of ACKACK_TIMESTAMP should represent T_SENDER , and be ~RTT/2 in the past. Therefore, the above equation can be considered as DRIFT = T_NOW - (T_NOW - T_SENDER + T_SENDER) -> 0 if the link latency remains constant. Assuming that the link latency is constant (RTT=const), the only cause of the drift fluctuations should be clock inaccuracy. Drift Tracer should consider RTT Time drift sample in SRT versions before v1.4.4 does not take RTT fluctuations into account. Instead an increase of RTT will be treated as a time drift. See PR 1965 . Drift Tracing and Adjustment Drift tracing is based on accumulating the sum of drift samples. DriftSum - the sum of the time drift samples on a MAX_SPAN number of samples. DriftSpan is the current number of accumulated samples. The default value of MAX_SPAN is 1000 samples. The default value of MAX_DRIFT is 5000 \u03bcs (5 ms). The default value of CLEAR_ON_UPDATE is true . On each DriftSpan sample, the average drift value Drift is updated as Drift = DriftSum / DriftSpan . The values of DriftSpan and DriftSum are reset to 0. If the absolute value of the Drift exceeds MAX_DRIFT ( |Drift| > MAX_DRIFT ), the remainder goes to OverDrift value. The value of OverDrift is used to update the TsbPdTimeBase . In pseudo-code it looks like this: bool update(int64_t driftval) { DriftSum += driftval; ++DriftSpan; if (m_uDriftSpan < MAX_SPAN) return false; if (CLEAR_ON_UPDATE) Overdrift = 0; Drift = DriftSum / DriftSpan; DriftSum = 0; DriftSpan = 0; if (std::abs(Drift) > MAX_DRIFT) { Overdrift = Drift < 0 ? -MAX_DRIFT : MAX_DRIFT; Drift -= Overdrift; } // Drift value was updated return true; } Consider RTTVar before changin the Drift value RTTVar expresses the variation of RTT values over time. Those variations should be considered when Drift is updated.
